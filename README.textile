h2. About

_jQuery Simple Color_ is a very simple color-picker plugin that displays a square grid of colors to select from. I found a lot of the other color-picker plugins quite heavy, so I ended up writing this to provide a dead-simple alternative. The list of colors it uses can be customized, and the layout size etc can be configured to a certain extent. _jQuery Simple Color_ is licensed under the "MIT license":http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php .

h2. Installation

You'll need to download the "jQuery library":http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#Current_Release , and include it before jquery.simple-color.js in your HTML source. See the _examples_ folder for examples.

h2. Building From Scratch

You can build the regular, un-minified version simply by running _ant_:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ant
Buildfile: build.xml

jquery.simple-color:
     [echo] Building ./jquery.simple-color.js
     [echo] ./jquery.simple-color.js built.

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 0 seconds
{% endhighlight %}

Before you can build the minified version yourself, you'll need to download the "Google Closure Compiler":http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip and put it in a folder called _build_:

{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ wget http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip
$ unzip compiler-latest.zip
{% endhighlight %}

Once you have the compiler, you can build the minified version by running _ant min_:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ant min
Buildfile: build.xml

jquery.simple-color:
     [echo] Building ./jquery.simple-color.js
     [echo] ./jquery.simple-color.js built.

min:
     [echo] Building ./jquery.simple-color.min.js
    [apply] Applied java to 1 file and 0 directories.
   [delete] Deleting: /Users/dave/Documents/Code/jquery/jquery-simple-color/tmpmin
     [echo] ./jquery.simple-color.min.js built.
